# Daily Prayer

I created this as a little C command-line application to help me practice writing and using strings in C. It has quickly expanded into something different from that. I am Anglican with some Catholic mixed in, but also grew up Mormon. Prayer is an important daily practice for me and I love to pray the daily office. I just don't always have the time or energy to crack open the Book of Common Prayer or to use St. Augustine's prayer book. I do, however, have all the time to sit on my computer while praying the rosary.

The main screen offers 2 options: to pray the rosary or to pray the divine mercy chaplet. However, I will move these so that they are sub-options within the main option. 

Our main options will include: 

1. Daily office according to the Book of Common Prayer and prayers found within St. Augustine's prayer book.
2. Miscelanious litanies and prayer cycles
3. Stations of the Cross and Stations of the Resurrection
4. Prayers and at home practices for seasons and special occations


Other features I will work on will be:
1. common creeds, prayers and collects from ancient sources
2. Daily readings according to the BCP and RCL
3. A Psalmery
